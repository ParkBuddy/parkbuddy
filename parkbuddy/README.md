# ParkBuddy

Welcome to the ParkBuddy project.

## Description

A parking meter app that lets you pay for your parking spot on your phone. No more rushing back to your parking spot to insert more coins in the parking meter!

## Details

This project is aimed at benefitting 2 groups. The drivers, and the city. By making it easy and convenient for drivers to pay for parking on their phone or on the web, we remove the hassle of scrambling for coins and rushing back to top off the parking meter. This allows them to be present at the reason they were parked there in the first place. Cities benefit from increased revenue, and lower costs of managing parking violations.

## Technology Stack

The intention is to write the app in Javascript and related technologies. You are welcome to argue the merits of using other technologies.
